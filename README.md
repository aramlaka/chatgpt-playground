Random chatGpt generated code 

# Running HTML Files
The easiest way to run these locally is to setup a local HTTP server.
I use the VsCode extension [liveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) 

Some examples:

_Note: These prompts are summaries/starters for multiple conversations with chatGpt. To get these final results, I had to adjust the prompts over time, ex.) for the kinetic movement I had to request "Can you increase the amount of the kinetic objects? Can you make them have random colors?"_

_Can you make a 3D webGl program with a controllable character. When the space bar is pressed, can you spawn random objects that grow in size until they collide with one another?_
