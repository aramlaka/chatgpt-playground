_Note: These prompts are summaries/starters for multiple conversations with chatGpt. To get these final results, I had to adjust the prompts over time, ex.) for the kinetic movement I had to request "Can you increase the amount of the kinetic objects? Can you make them have random colors?"_

_Can you make a 3D webGl program with a controllable character. When the space bar is pressed, can you spawn random objects that grow in size until they collide with one another?_
